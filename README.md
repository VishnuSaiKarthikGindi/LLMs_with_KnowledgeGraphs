This project focuses on developing RAG application by extracting and processing healthcare data to create a structured graph database using Neo4j. The data includes patient demographics, medical history, medications, lab results, and visits, which are processed using large language models like gpt or llama to identify entities and relationships. These entities and relationships are then stored in a Neo4j database to enable complex queries and insights from the data. 

Traditionally, RAG systems utilize vector-based databases to retrieve relevant information. However, using graph databases like Neo4j offers unique advantages in organizing and accessing interconnected data efficiently. With Cypher queries, RAG systems can quickly navigate and retrieve relevant information, enhancing response accuracy.
